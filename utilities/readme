Usage:

- SISSO_predict.f90: read descriptor formulas from SISSO.out, and make prediction on unknown materials.
1. How to install: ifort SISSO_predict.f90 -o ~/bin SISSO_predict
2. How to use: run 'SISSO_predict' at your working directory
3. Needed input files: predict.dat (containing the test materials and features, 
   with exactly the same format with train.dat); SISSO_predict_para (parameters for running this code; 
   if this file is not present, the code will ask for input interactively).
4. Output files: predict_X.out (descriptor coordinates of the test materials); predict_Y.out 
   (predicted values of the target property of the test materials).
5. Note: please make sure that no 'operator' name is used for the feature names. E.g.: if one feature is named 'a', 
   then 'abs()' will be mistakenly translated as xxxbs(), where xxx is the value of 'a'.


- SVC.py: find the SVC hyperplane for classification with the descriptor from SISSO
1. How to use: run 'python SVC.py >out' at your working directory where the file train.dat should present.
2. Format of train.dat: column1,sample-string; column2,target-label(1/-1); column3-,components of the descriptor)
3. Note: please check SVC.py and make changes wherever necessary for your application.

- k-fold-cv (leave-percent-out-cv): creating sub-datasetS for cv with SISSO
1. Set the parameter at line 12 in the file k-fold-cv.f90 (leave-percent-out-cv.f90)
2. Compile the program: ifort k-fold-cv -o kfoldcv (ifort leave-percent-out-cv.f90 -o lpocv)
3. With the all-data train.dat and corresponding SISSO.in in the working directory, run kfoldcv (lpocv) to generate k folders
4. Sumbit the k SISSO jobs
5. Collect and analyze your cv results from the k folders

- Ionic_Radii
The table of extended Shannon radii (R. Ouyang, Chem. Mater. 32, 595 (2020).

- af2traindat.f90: Automatically creating the train.dat with atomic features for each compound.
1. Prepare the two input files: atom_features (list of atomic features) and samplelist (list of samples). See templates in this folder for the format.
2. Comiple and run the code af2traindat.f90
